# Machine Learning Based Asthma Risk Assessment Using IoT

## Project Description
This project predicts asthma risk using environmental sensors and machine learning.  
ESP8266 collects temperature, humidity, dust, MQ2, MQ135 data and sends to a Flask ML server.  
XGBoost model predicts asthma attack risk in real-time and triggers buzzer and GSM SMS alerts.
